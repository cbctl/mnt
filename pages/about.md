I'm Claudia, a [software engineer](https://cbctl.dev) by day and a hiking/outdoor enthusiast... also by day
(unless there is a full moon or I know the area).
I live in the south of the UK with my wife and our two cats.

I use this blog to talk about trips, gear, training and hiking with chronic pain/injury.

If you want to ask me anything, please shoot me an [email](mailto:claudia@cbctl.dev) :)
