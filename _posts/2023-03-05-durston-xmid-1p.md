My new x-mid arrived just after Christmas. I have not taken it out on a trip
yet,but after a couple of test nights in my local forest, I thought I'd do a
quick 'initial thoughts' review because I am THAT EXCITED about this tent.

These tents by Dan Durston are some of the most sought-after in the world and
have achieved cult status and insane levels of hype. I am looking forward to see
whether this tent lives up to it on my Cape Wrath Trail hike this spring.

**Note that this review is just initial thoughts, I have not done any thorough
testing yet.**

### Tell me more...

#### What I like

- **The pitch is just too easy.** I mean it's like a joke. I first set this up
	in my parents' garden with my dad (who hiked a lot in the days when the only
	gear was the heavy and bulky kind), and he just could not believe the
	simplicity and intelligence of design. Even my mum (does not understand the
	appeal of camping) noted that she didn't think tents that easy to pitch and
	pack could exist.
	The most striking thing for me was that the smart design means the first pole
	you put in is fully supported by itself. With other trekking pole tents, such as my
	[Tarptent Notch][notch-post], after you put the first pole in you go through
	this funny balencing act where it wobbles around or falls over until the
	second one is in and you begin tensioning. Not so with the x-mid. Each pole is
	held by 3 seams, so you put in the first pole... and it just stays up, with
	real tension.
- **It is so easy to roll away into the stuff-sack.** I do not like stuffing my
	tents. I like to fold and roll away, all neat and tidy, with the inner fully
	protected and dry and everything predictably located when I pull it out again
	later. This is really hard to do with sil-nylon tents, especially the
	ultralight ones, as they are just so slippery. Dyneema tents are great for
	rolling, and indeed it is recommended that you roll that material anyway. The
	x-mid is made with sil-poly, so I was worried that I would have the same
	'slipperiness' problem as with nylon, but was pleasantly suprised! It takes me
	around the same time to roll away as it does to set up, and I am delighted!
- **The room inside is insane!** I have never had this much space in an 1 person
	test. If you removed the inner, you could easily get 2 people under the fly.
	On my first night out I only used one of the vestibules because they are just
	so big I didn't need two: I literaly forgot the other one was there until the
	next morning and the second one's presence genuinely suprised me.
- **Condensation management seems really good** so far. My test nights so far
	have had some common elements: sub zero C, completely still with not a breath
	of wind, and pitches in very sheltered locations for stealth reasons. In other
	tents in that location with similar conditions, the inside of my tents have
	ranged from 'dripping' to 'very very damp' in the morning. The xmid seems to
	handled this very well, probably because there is just so much space inside
	for air to flow. The only damp places I could feel in the morning was a patch
	around the apex directly above my head.
- **There is so much space between me, the inner, and the fly.** Any
	condensation that does form on the inside is just so far away. If I lie down
	(on a not massively bullky pad) and reach straight up, I am not able to touch
	the inner apex. The vestibules run the length of the tent, and even at their
	narrower ends the fly is still a good few inches from the inner. The head and
	foot ends of the inner are also much longer than even a long sleeping pad, so
	the chances of anyone under 6'5" getting a wet footbox are very slim. (I am
	5'8" for context.)
- **The two huge vestibules** give you so much room for stuff.
- Likewise **the space at the head and foot ends** is plenty for bringing
	everything you want inside. People who use regular width pads will also have a
	ton of space next to them.
- **Large rectangular pads** like the Nemo Tensor Regular wide will also fit with
	a couple inches of gap at the side. This is a huge deal for me as I have to
	sleep on a wide comfy pad or my SI joint pain will be screaming at me the next
	day,
- **The inner and the vestibules are large enough for me to crouch in**, not
	just sit up. I am 5'8" and very skinny so this wont be true for everyone, but
	pretty much everyone will find the xmid extremely livable.
- Lastly, **the price is just so damn good**. $240 for an ultralight tent _this
	well designed_ is just stunning. If you consider the Lanshan sits around £130,
	and big name brands like the MSR Hubba Hubba is around £400, with dyneema
	tents easily above $500, $240 ($300 for the 2p) makes the x-mid series genuine
	contenders for the most budget-friendly high-spec tents on the market.

#### What I don't

- **No two way zippers on the fly doors.** This is just irritating, as I like to
	unzip from the top for more ventilation, as well as to insert/remov my trekking
	poles without having to open the whole door.
- **The pockets are in the roof of the inner.** I noted above that I can't reach
	the top of the inner while lying down, so yeh, having stuff stashed up there
	is annoying. I usually put my phone in a pocked by my head, so now I will just
	have to have it lying on the floor next to me.
- **There are no loops or hooks or tabs at the top of the inner** so there is
	nowhere to hang a line. This again is not the end of the world, just an
	irritation.
- I have no proof of this yet, but **I am not sure how the tent will handle
	broad-side winds**. There is no way to properly tension the largest panels
	(the tab half way down will not do anything beyond stop a bit of flapping),
	so I am interested to see how that goes.

Hope this is useful for now, once I am back from the CWT I will post a full review!
