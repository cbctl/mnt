I have Sacro-Iliac Joint Dysfunction.

I am going to talk more about what that means in another post, but the main point is:
I cannot walk without pain in my hips/upper thigh. And I likely will have this pain
for the rest of my life.

But I don't want to stop hiking. I also like to be able to do simple things like
walk to the shops without it setting me back for a week.

The one thing that helps SI joint pain is muscle, especially core. So I train. All. The. Time.

This is my routine, based pretty much entirely around [Chase Tucker's][chase-yt]
excellent [training programs][chase-train]. These are paid-for programs, so I will not
share his unlisted links to some content as you should really invest in that yourself. A lot of his
content is free and those links I will share.

### Year round maintenance

If you stay ready you don't have to get ready, as the Queens say.

**Monday**
- 10 min warm up (cat cow, deep lunges, down-dog peddle, [hip-flexor routine][hip-flexor],
	[ankle mobility][ankle-mobility], 1 min plank, 1 min deep squat, dead bug)
- 10 push ups
- 30 min lower body strength (from Chase's [Elements][elements] program)
	The reverse lunge move here used to aggravate my
	SI joint, but eventually I built up enough muscle that I could come back to it
	and now 99% it is doable for me. I use this as a benchmark for maintaining a minimum
	level of strength.
- [Balance practice][balance]
- Heel lifts (idk what this is actually called, but I stand with the balls of my feet
	at the edge of a step and lower my heels as far as I can then raise up onto my toes.
	I repeat this 10 times with feet together, 10 times with toes together and heels out,
	10 times with heels together and toes out, then 10 times on one foot at a time).

**Tuesday**

- 10 min warm up (cat cow, deep lunges, down-dog peddle, [hip-flexor routine][hip-flexor],
	[ankle mobility][ankle-mobility], 1 min plank, 1 min deep squat, dead bug, hip hinge)
- 10 push ups
- 5 mile hike as fast as I can with 10-11kg backpack. I live near a lovely forest
	in the [South Downs][downs], so I have a good mix of hills to add to the challenge.
	SI pain is worse when your body repeats an identical motion over a long time, so uneven terrain with
	hills, roots and rocks is miles better.
	The weight is to add resistance, and to keep my body used to the trail. My base-weight is
	5kg, and I don't ever carry more than 8-9kg, so I try to add 2kg above that when I train.
	I cannot run with SI pain (the 'bouncing' motion is not good), so the weight plus
	the speed gives me a good cardio workout.

**Wednesday**

- Chase's [Daily Movement Routine][daily]
- 10 push ups
- Chase's [Core Stability Routine][core] or Core Foundations from [Elements][elements]
- Heel lifts

**Thursday**

- 10 min warm up (cat cow, deep lunges, down-dog peddle, [hip-flexor routine][hip-flexor],
	[ankle mobility][ankle-mobility], 1 min plank, 1 min deep squat, dead bug, hip hinge)
- 10 push ups
- 5 mile hike as fast as I can with 10-11kg backpack

**Friday**

- Chase's Intermediate Daily Routine from [Elements][elements]. The "hip thrusting"
	move here is one I cannot do with my SI problem. I come back to it now and then,
	to see if anything has changed, but it is usually aggravating so I skip it.
- 1 min deep squat
- Chase's Upper Body Strength routine from [Elements][elements]
- Heel lifts

**Saturday**

This depends on what I have going on. If nothing, 10-15 mile hike with 5-10kg backpack.
This one is not a race.

If I am busy, then I will do my usual plank, squat, pushup and stretch bit, or
Chase's [5 Minute Routine][5min].

**Sunday**

[5 Min Routine][5min].

[5 Min Routine][5min]. Stretching and maintenance.

### 1 week before a big hike

Take it easy. Maintenance routines only. Some chill walks.

### On the hike

I start and finish each day with the [Daily Move][daily].

With these practices I can keep my SI pain to a minimum and enjoy hiking 20+ miles
a day, every day, over insane terrain and hundreds of miles.

Yes sometimes I do get bored and really want a day off, but if I let that happen too
much then I really feel it, so I have to stay disciplined.

That said, my most recent trip was planned in about 2 weeks, and by smashing the "3 weeks"
section above I was able to walk 110miles in Norway with basically no pain or stiffness. I could
easily have turned around and done it all again.

The best time to start training is right now, but if you have suddenly decided on a trip
and don't want to start cold, Chase's routines are very good to get you prepped.
